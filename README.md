# HappyNumbers

A Happy Number is where the sum of the squares in each digit eventually reaches 1. 

For example 23 is a Happy Number:

2^2 + 3^2 = 13
1^2 + 3^2 = 10
1^2 + 0^2 = 1

However this just 10-happy number as we use numbers in base 10. What about a 2-happy number, a 16-happy number for a 147-happy number?
